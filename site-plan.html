      <h2>Wheels and Tires</h2>
      <h4>Wheels</h4>
      <p>Warp9 is a great company that can make custom wheels for your bike. You can choose rim size, rim color, hub color, nipple color, and spoke color, as well as sprocket size, and rotor size for your wheels. Their wheels are also much stronger and more durable than the stock wheels. Wheel Setups</p>

      <h4>16 19</h4>
      <p>The 16 19 wheel setup is very popular for the Sur Ron. It has the best power to weight ratio, and keeps the bike small and nimble. It also greatly improves the traction and handling of the bike. There is an amazing 16” tire selection that will fit the Sur Ron.</p>

      <h4>18 21</h4>
      <p>The 18 21 wheel setup is great for bigger riders who would like to make their bike bigger in stature. It also greatly improves the traction and handling of the bike as well. This is the same wheel setup that you will typically find on a full size dirt bike. The bigger 21 inch front wheel makes it much easier to roll over terrain.</p>

      <h4>17 17</h4>
      <p>The 17 17 wheel setup is great if you would like to run supermoto tires. There is a large selection of 17 “ supermoto tires that will fit the Sur Ron.</p>

      <h4>12 12</h4>
      <p>The 12 12 wheel setup is great if you want to make like the Sur Ron feel smaller like a mini stunt bike. It will also feel torquier and it will be easier to do wheelers.</p>

      <h4>Tires</h4>
      <p>Supermoto Tires</p>
      <p>Supermoto tires are great for people who ride pretty much 100% on road. The provide much more grip on the pavement. Supermoto tires mostly come in 17 inch wheel sizes. They are available in other wheel sizes, but 17 in wheels have largest supermoto tire selection. Charged Cycle Works has a big selection of tires that can fit on the Sur Ron and Segway. They have an entire data base of upgraded tires with the size, weight, and compatibility.</p>

      <h4>Dual Sport Tires</h4>
      <p>Dual sport tires are great for people who ride about 30% off road, and 70% on road. Some great options for dual sport tires are the Shinko 241 and the Shinko 244.</p> 

      <h4>Dirt Tires</h4>
      <p>Dirt tires probably have the largest selection of tires for the most wheel sizes of any of the tire types. Popular tires to run on a 16” rear wheel are.the Shinko R525 Hybrid Cheater, Bridgestone Battleross X30, Kenda Washugal II, and Dunlop MX33. Popular tires to run on the stock front or rear 19” wheels are Shinko 524, Tusk Recon Sticky 19” Tire, Dunlop MX33 Soft Terrain Front Tire, and Dunlop MX53 Hard Terrain Front Tire.</p>

      <h4>Sand Tires</h4>
      <p>The Sur Ron can be ridden in soft sand, but it struggles to gain traction while cornering, and accelerating in the sand. To solve this issue you will need a paddle tire. There are no paddle tires that will fit on the stock rear wheel. So you will need to upgrade to a 16” rear wheel in order to fit a paddle tire on the Sur Ron.</p>

      <h4>66v</h4>
      <p>A 66 volt battery will also work right out of the box as a drop in upgrade with the stock controller.</p>
      <h4>72v Batteries</h4>
      <p>72 volt batteries require an aftermarket controller to work.</p>
      <h3>Companies</h3>
      <p>Chi, Lite Speed Bikes</p>
      <h3>Controller Upgrades</h3>
      <p>An upgraded controller gives the Sur Ron a lot more power when paired with an upgraded batter. This will double or even triple the speed of your bike. They also give you the ability to tune the power levels in sport and eco mode to your liking. As well as increasing, decreasing, or disabling the regenerative braking. Aftermarket controllers give you the ability to run an upgraded 60 or 72 volt battery for more power, top speed, and range. Check out the battery page for more information on battery upgrade.</p>
