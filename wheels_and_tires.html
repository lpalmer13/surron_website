        <img id="sand-tire-img" src="images/surron_paddle_tire.webp" alt="surron paddle tire">
        <p>The Sur Ron can be ridden in soft sand, but it struggles to gain traction while cornering, and accelerating in the sand. To solve this issue you will need a paddle tire. There are no paddle tires that will fit on the stock rear wheel. So you will need to upgrade to a 16” rear wheel in order to fit a paddle tire on the Sur Ron.</p>
